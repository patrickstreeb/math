  - In this folder I am planning to create an html file for each quiz question type we implemented. 
    Additionally there Will be one file connecting them all in a course layout to see if the functionality works in this context.

  - The questions are updated here if changes are made so we have the most current version available in this folder.

  - The format is unified similar to 
    
            <div class="question">
                QUESTION
            <\div>

  - in order to beeing able to fill them out later quickly for editing a course.

  - the files provide the html to display the question and the javascript link in order to beeing able to execute them.



  IMPORTANT NOTE: Safe files exactly in the environment which is working in the chapters folder e.g. right amount of div-depth etc.
